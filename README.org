* Mewtastic
I'm a self taught student. I mainly focus on programming games, although I do use Linux and do a lot of scripting and contributions focused on Linux. When it comes to making video games most of my interest isn't in programming them, but designing them. Especially designing game mechanics and general game play. I'm always looking for someone willing to help me out and contribute to my projects.
